Thank you for your interested in the Directed Reading Program at UD!
</h1>
</center>

DRP's are mathematics mentorship programs, pairing undergraduate students with graduate student mentors for a semester-long reading project.
The goal of this program is to provide a relaxed, informal, and inclusive introduction to some new mathematics, and offer you a chance to
learn more about what it's like to be a grad student in mathematics. 

<br>
<br>

In keeping with that goal, there are <b>no grades</b> and no credits
involved. However, it is expected that you will meet with your mentor once per week for about an hour, and spend 3-4 hours per week reading on your own.

<br>
<br>

So, what are some reasons you might want to participate in the program?

<ul>
<li> If you are considering a major in math, you will have the opportunity to explore what math looks like beyond, for example, calculus. You might be surprised
by how many different topics there are after calculus! (Hint: there's a <i>ton</i>.)
<li> If you are considering applying to grad school in math, participating in a DRP can look great on a resume/CV. You'll also work one-on-one with a current
grad student and be able to get a feel for what their day-to-day life is like!
<li> Math can actually be a lot of fun! If you've only ever "done math" for a class, the DRP offers a totally different approach: with your grad student mentor,
you'll pick your own topic and move at your own pace.
</ul>

Some possible topics include:

<ul>
<li> Topological data anlaysis: how can we use the tools of "topology" to extract useful information from "big data" sets? What is "topology" in the first place?
<li> Knots! Yep, there's a rigorous mathematical study of knots (as in, what you use to tie your shoes) with applications
to all sorts of things, even theoretical particle physics!
<li> Whatever else interests you! We will work to pair you with a mentor who can advise you in a topic that is relevant to your studies and interests, whatever
they may be.
</ul>

to seeing you in the Spring!
