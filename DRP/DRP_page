Thank you for your interested in the Directed Reading Program at UD!
</h1>
</center>

DRP's are mathematics mentorship programs, pairing undergraduate students with grad student mentors for a semester-long reading project.
The goal of this program is to be a relaxed, informal, and inclusive introduction to some new mathematics, and offer you a chance to
learn more about what it's like to be a grad student in mathematics. 

<br>
<br>

In keeping with that goal, there are <b>no grades</b> and no credit
involved. It is expected that you will meet with your mentor once per week for about an hour, and spend 3-4 hours per week reading on your own.

<br>
<br>

So, what are some reasons you might want to participate in the program?
