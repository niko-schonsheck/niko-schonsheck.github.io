<h1>About me</h1>

<main>
<hr>


I am an applied algebraic topologist. I am interested in both developing the theoretical tools of topological data analysis and applying these tools to real-world data, with a particular view towards theoretical neuroscience. I am currently an Independent Fellow at the <a href="https://www.rockefeller.edu/research/interdisciplinary-centers/center-studies-physics-biology/">Center for Studies in Physics and Biology</a> at the Rockefeller University. Prevsiouy, I worked with <a href="http://www.chadgiusti.com/">Chad Giusti</a> as a postdoc at the <a href="https://www.mathsci.udel.edu/">University of Delaware</a> in the Department of Mathematical Sciences. Before that, I studied  theoretical mathematics at (The) Ohio State University, where I earned my PhD under <a href="https://people.math.osu.edu/harper.903/">John E. Harper</a> in homotopy theory. Here is a copy of my <a href="2024_teaching_CV.pdf">CV</a> (last updated September 2024).

<br><br>

In addition to my research, I very much enjoy teaching. I have served as an instructor both at the University of Delaware and as a graduate student at Ohio State, where I also served as a TA for a wide variety of courses. My teaching has been recognized both at the departmental and university level. Most recently, I was independently nominated for the University of Delaware's Excellence in Teaching Award. As a graduate student in 2020, I received the Graduate Associate Teaching Award, Ohio State’s highest recognition of teaching excellence by graduate students. For more information, please see my teaching section below.

<h1>Research</h1>
</center>
<hr>

My research is in applied algebraic topology and uses topological tools to analyze and compare high-dimensional data sets. In further detail, my work focuses on 1) reducing the dimensionality of large data sets in topologically-invariant ways, 2) using tools from topological data analysis to study the geometry of neural representations and neural circuits, using both real-world and simulated data, and 3) developing novel theoretical approaches to modern applied problems using advanced tools from algebraic topology and homotopy theory. 

<br><br>

My PhD research was in homotopy theory and studied spectra with additional algebraic structure described by an operad. I used tools from category theory, functor calculus, and chromatic homotopy theory to prove a number of results identifying conditions under which complex algebraic structure can be recovered by "gluing together" simpler approximations. A brief summary of this work, made for the <a href="https://s.wayne.edu/echt/electronic-algebraic-topology-employment-network/">eATEN</a>, can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8fOPadRn4"> here.</a><br><br>

<b> O(k)-equivariant dimensionality reduction on Stiefel manifolds </b>
<br>
(with A. Lee, H. Lee, J. Perea, M. Weinstein).
<br>
Many real-world data sets live on high-dimensional Stiefel manifolds and benefit from projections onto lower-dimensional Stiefel manifolds. We describe an algorithm, called <i>Principal Stiefel Coordinates</i>, that accomplishes this, and does so in an equivariant way. Hence, our algorithm extends to data living on Grassmannian manifolds as well. We perform multiple numerical experiments on real-world and synthetic data sets.

<br>
We describe a method to obtain spherical parameterizations of arbitrary data through the use of persistent cohomology and variational optimization. This builds on the "circular coordinates" of de Silva--Morozov--Vejdemo-Johansson and Perea, answering in the affirmative a question first posed by de Silva et al. in 2011. (22 pages).

<br>
The circular coordinates algorithm of de Silva, Morozov, and Vejdemo-Johansson takes as input a dataset together with a cohomology class representing a 1-dimensional hole in the data; the output is a map from the data into the circle that captures this geometric feature and that is of minimal energy in a suitable sense. However, when applied to several cohomology classes, the output circle-valued maps can be “geometrically correlated” even if the chosen cohomology classes are linearly independent. We describe a systematic procedure for constructing low energy torus-valued maps on data, and showcase our procedure with computational examples. (20 pages).

<b> On the chromatic localization of the homotopy completion tower for O-algebras</b> (with C. Ogle).
<br>
<i> New York Journal of Mathematics, <b> 28 </b>, 1042-1056, 2022. </i>
<br>
The completion tower of a nonunital commutative ring is a classical construction in commutative algebra. In the setting of structured ring spectra as modeled by algebras over a spectral operad, the analogous construction is the homotopy completion tower. The purpose of this brief note is to show that localization with respect to the Johnson-Wilson spectrum E(n) commutes with the terms of this tower.

<b> TQ-completion and the Taylor tower of the identity functor.</b>
<br>
<i>Journal of Homotopy and Related Structures</i> 
<b> 17</b> (2) 201-216, 2022. 
<br>
This paper studies the convergence of the Taylor tower of the identity functor in the context of operadic algebras in spectra. Specifically, we show that if a A is a (-1)-connected O-algebra with 0-connected TQ-homology spectrum, then there is a natural weak equivalence between the limit of the Taylor tower of the identity functor evaluated on A and the TQ-completion of A. Since, in this context, the identity functor is only known to be 0-analytic, this result extends knowledge of the Taylor tower of the identity beyond its "radius of convergence."

Working in the context of algebras over a spectral operad, we prove that completion with respect to topological Quillen homology preserves homotopy fibration sequences in which the base and total objects are connected. More generally, we show that similar results remain true if we replace "homotopy fibration sequence" with "homotopy pullback square."

<b> Relative neural population size modulates learnability of cyclic features of neural code</b><br>
(with C. Giusti).
<br>
We study the propagation of cyclic features of neural code through feedforward rate-model networks. Our primary results are 1) one-layer feedforward networks with connections drawn from a random distribution biased towards inhibitory connections do not generally propagate cyclic features of neural code 2) a simple Hebbian learning rule to update network connections successfully constructs networks that do propagate cyclic features and 3) under certain biologically plausible parameter choices, the inhibition and propagation of such features can be modulated by the size of the output neuron population.

A classical theorem of C. H. Dowker implies that, from a topological perspective, the role of "witnesses" and "landmarks" of a data set are interchangeable. We generalize this theorem to multi-way relations of sets. We offer several proofs from a variety of perspectives, and discuss the historical development of results of this nature.

<i> Relative neural population size modulates learnability of cyclic features of neural code.</i>
<br>
Cyclic structures are a class of mesoscale features ubiquitous in both experimental stimuli and the activity of neural populations encoding them. Important examples include encoding of head direction, orientation tuning, and grid cells. The central question of our present work is: how does the brain faithfully transmit cyclic structures between regions? Is this a generic feature of neural circuits, or must this be learned? If so, how? Our primary results are 1) feedforward networks with connections drawn from inhibitory-biased random distributions do not reliably propagate cyclic features, 2) updating network connections with a biologically realistic Hebbian learning rule robustly constructs networks that transmit cyclic features, and 3) the inhibition and propagation of such features can be modulated by the size of the output neuron population.

<i>Spherical parameterizations of data via persistent cohomology</i>
<br>
The circular coordinates algorithm of de Silva et al., later strengthened by Perea, extracts circular parameterizations of data from a persistent cohomology calculation. In other words, given a data set X, one can obtain coordinate functions from X to the unit circle via fist-degree persistent cohomology. Since these results were first published a little over a decade ago, the question of whether spherical coordinates, i.e., maps from X to the unit sphere, could be obtained from second-degree persistent cohomology remained open. In this talk, I will discuss work in which we obtain such spherical parameterizations and describe examples of our algorithm on various data sets. This is joint work with Stefan Schonsheck.

By considering algebras over an operad O in one's preferred category of spectra, we can encode various flavors of algebraic structure (e.g. commutative ring spectra). Topological Quillen (TQ) homology is a naturally occurring notion of homology for these objects, with analogies to both singular homology and stabilization of spaces. In this talk, we will begin by discussing a fibration theorem for TQ-completion, showing that TQ-completion preserves fibration sequences in which the base and total O-algebra are connected. We will then describe a few results that hint towards an intrinsic connection between TQ-completion and the convergence of the Taylor tower of the identity functor in the category of O-algebras. Lastly, time permitting, we will discuss recent joint work with Crichton Ogle on the chromatic localization of the homotopy completion tower of O-algebras and connections to functor calculus.

<i> TQ-completion: fibration theorems and connections to functor calculus</i>
<br>
By considering algebras over an operad O in one's preferred category of spectra, we can encode various flavors of algebraic structure (e.g. commutative ring spectra). Topological Quillen (TQ) homology is a naturally occurring notion of homology for these objects, with analogies to both singular homology and stabilization of spaces. For a given O-algebra X, there is a canonical way to "glue together" iterates TQ^n(X) of the TQ-homology spectrum of X to construct "the part of X that TQ-homology sees," namely its TQ-completion. A natural question to ask is, "When can X be 'recovered from' TQ(X) in this way?" A step towards answering this question is to understand the behavior of fibration sequences under TQ-completion. In this talk, we will discuss just that: a fibration theorem which shows that TQ-completion preserves fibration sequences in which the base and total O-algebra are connected. Time permitting, we will also discuss a few preliminary results that hint towards an intrinsic connection between TQ-completion and the convergence of the Taylor tower of the identity functor in the category of O-algebras.

<I> TQ-completion of certain fibration sequences </I>
<br>
By considering algebras over an operad O in one's preferred category of spectra, we can encode various flavors of algebraic structure (e.g. commutative ring spectra). Drawing intuition from singular homology of spaces and Quillen homology of rings, topological Quillen (TQ) homology is a naturally occurring notion of homology for these objects, with analogies to both singular homology and stabilization of spaces. 

For a given O-algebra X, there is a canonical way (following Bousfield-Kan) to "glue together" iterates TQ^n(X) of the TQ-homology spectrum of X to construct "the part of X that TQ-homology sees," namely its TQ-completion. We then ask, "When can X be 'recovered from' TQ(X) in this way?"

Bousfield-Kan consider the analogous question in spaces and conclude that all nilpotent spaces are weakly equivalent to their homology completion. The key technical maneuver of their proof involves showing that certain fibration sequences are preserved by completion. In this talk, we will review the construction of TQ-homology and discuss certain types of fibration sequences of O-algebras which are preserved by TQ-completion.<br>

<I> Topological Quillen homology of structured ring spectra </I>
<br>
Around 2000, a number of new categories of spectra were created that carry with them additional structure in the form of a smash product, providing a rich setting in which to study spaces and spectra. By considering algebras over an operad O in one of these new categories (e.g. symmetric spectra) we can encode various flavors of algebraic structure now afforded to us, such as that of a commutative ring spectrum. In order to study these algebras, we introduce a filtration of the operad itself which, in turn, filters the encoded structure of its corresponding algebras. As luck would have it, this can recover the Taylor tower of the identity functor and the initial term in the tower is the topological Quillen homology of an O-algebra — weakly equivalent to stabilization and analogous to the Quillen homology of a commutative ring. In this talk, we will review these constructions in more detail and conclude with a discussion of ongoing research in this area.

<br>
<I> Homotopy theory -- from the fundamental group to structured ring spectra </I>
<br>
Topological spaces can be found in almost all areas of mathematics; examples abound and include subsets of Euclidean space, metric spaces, and much more. Given two spaces, one of the most basic questions we can ask is, "Are they the same?" and the search for an answer to this seemingly simple question has led to the creation of an incredible amount of both deep and beautiful mathematics. This talk will begin with a discussion of one of the first answers to this question -- namely the fundamental group of Poincaré. Seeking to improve on this construction will naturally lead us to define the higher homotopy groups of a space. The study of these powerful invariants will, in turn, bring us to stable homotopy theory and the "brave new algebra" of structured ring spectra and we will conclude with a direction of current research. Much of this talk will be general in nature and should be accessible to any undergraduate who has taken, e.g. linear algebra. *No familiarity* with topology will be assumed and, though potentially helpful, experience with group theory is certainly not necessary.

<b>Young Topologists Meeting, University of Copenhagen (2018)</b>
<br>
<I> An introduction to symmetric spectra </I>
<br>
In this expository talk, we begin by briefly motivating and recalling the classical notion of a spectrum, and how to obtain the stable homotopy category as it was first defined. We then examine a conceptually simpler way to view spectra – as modules over the sphere spectrum, a (noncommutative) monoid. By taking this viewpoint, we will see why defining a symmetric monoidal product on the category of spectra is problematic, just as in classical algebra, the tensor product of two R-modules does not itself necessarily carry the structure of an R-module if R is not commutative. This motivates the introduction of a symmetric group action on spectra, which turns the sphere spectrum into a commutative monoid, allowing a straightforward definition of the smash product on the category of symmetric spectra. We will conclude with a description of the stable model structure on symmetric spectra, and how it determines the classical stable homotopy category.

Other than math, I enjoy rock climbing, hiking, coffee, and the Oxford comma. I also love dogs, especially huskies.
<br><br>
My brother is a mathematician as well. If you arrived at this site looking for computational differential geometry or machine learning, you should check <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/stefancschonsheck/home">here</a> instead.
