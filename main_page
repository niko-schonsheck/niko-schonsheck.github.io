I am currently a postdoc working with <a href="http://www.chadgiusti.com/">Chad Giusti</a> on problems in Topological Data Analysis and Neuroscience at the <a href="https://www.mathsci.udel.edu/">University of Delaware.</a> Before this position, I studied more theoretical mathematics at (The) Ohio State University, where I earned my PhD under <a href="https://people.math.osu.edu/harper.903/">John E. Harper</a> researching the "brave new algebra" of structured ring spectra and related topics. Here is a copy of my <a href="https://people.math.osu.edu/schonsheck.2/Schonsheck_CV.pdf">CV</a> (last updated July 2022).

<br><br>

I very much enjoy teaching. I have served as an instructor both at the University of Delaware and as a graduate student at Ohio State, where I also served as a TA for a wide variety of courses. My teaching has been recognized both at the departmental and university level. In particular, in 2020, I received the Graduate Associate Teaching Award, Ohio Stateâ€™s highest recognition of teaching excellence by graduate students.

<h1>Research</h1>
</center>
<hr>

Mr research insterests span both applied and theoretical topology. On the applied side, I am interested in applications of topology to problems in neuroscience and data science. In particular, I study how the techniques of persistent (co)homology can be used to extract meaning from large data sets, and how cohomology classes can provide nonlinear coordinate systems for dimensionality reduction. I am also working on problems in equivariant dimensionality reduction, and independent coordinate analysis of circular coordinates. Looking towards the future, I am excited to see how methods from homotopy theory can be brought to bear on problems in applied topology.

<br><br>

On the more theoretical side, I am broadly interested in spectra with additional algebraic structure that can be described by an operad O. For example, while we can study E-infinity or A-infinity ring spectra with this type of machinery, operads also let us encode more general flavors of algebraic structure. I am pursuing a number of different research avenues within this setting. In joint work with Crichton Ogle, we recently showed that chromatic localization commutes with the terms of the Goodwillie Taylor Tower of the identity functor on O-algebras. A brief summary of my PhD research, made for the <a href="https://s.wayne.edu/echt/electronic-algebraic-topology-employment-network/">eATEN</a>, can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8fOPadRn4"> here.</a><br><br>

<b> On the chromatic localization of the homotopy completion tower for O-algebras</b> (with C. Ogle).
<br>
<i> To appear in New York Journal of Mathematics</i>, 2022.
<br>
The completion tower of a nonunital commutative ring is a classical construction in commutative algebra. In the setting of structured ring spectra as modeled by algebras over a spectral operad, the analogous construction is the homotopy completion tower. The purpose of this brief note is to show that localization with respect to the Johnson-Wilson spectrum E(n) commutes with the terms of this tower.

<b> TQ-completion and the Taylor tower of the identity functor.</b>
<br>
<i>Journal of Homotopy and Related Structures</i> 
<b> 17</b> (2) 201-216, 2022. 
<br>
This paper studies the convergence of the Taylor tower of the identity functor in the context of operadic algebras in spectra. Specifically, we show that if a A is a (-1)-connected O-algebra with 0-connected TQ-homology spectrum, then there is a natural weak equivalence between the limit of the Taylor tower of the identity functor evaluated on A and the TQ-completion of A. Since, in this context, the identity functor is only known to be 0-analytic, this result extends knowledge of the Taylor tower of the identity beyond its "radius of convergence."

<b> Fibration theorems for TQ-completion of structured ring spectra. </b>
<br>
<i> Tbilisi Math. Journal: Special Issue on Homotopy Theory, Spectra, and Structured Ring Spectra</i>, 2020.
<br>

Working in the context of algebras over a spectral operad, we prove that completion with respect to topological Quillen homology preserves homotopy fibration sequences in which the base and total objects are connected. More generally, we show that similar results remain true if we replace "homotopy fibration sequence" with "homotopy pullback square."

<i> Fibration theorems, functor calculus, and chromatic connections in O-algebras</i>
<br>
By considering algebras over an operad O in one's preferred category of spectra, we can encode various flavors of algebraic structure (e.g. commutative ring spectra). Topological Quillen (TQ) homology is a naturally occurring notion of homology for these objects, with analogies to both singular homology and stabilization of spaces. In this talk, we will begin by discussing a fibration theorem for TQ-completion, showing that TQ-completion preserves fibration sequences in which the base and total O-algebra are connected. We will then describe a few results that hint towards an intrinsic connection between TQ-completion and the convergence of the Taylor tower of the identity functor in the category of O-algebras. Lastly, time permitting, we will discuss recent joint work with Crichton Ogle on the chromatic localization of the homotopy completion tower of O-algebras and connections to functor calculus.

<i> TQ-completion: fibration theorems and connections to functor calculus</i>
<br>
By considering algebras over an operad O in one's preferred category of spectra, we can encode various flavors of algebraic structure (e.g. commutative ring spectra). Topological Quillen (TQ) homology is a naturally occurring notion of homology for these objects, with analogies to both singular homology and stabilization of spaces. For a given O-algebra X, there is a canonical way to "glue together" iterates TQ^n(X) of the TQ-homology spectrum of X to construct "the part of X that TQ-homology sees," namely its TQ-completion. A natural question to ask is, "When can X be 'recovered from' TQ(X) in this way?" A step towards answering this question is to understand the behavior of fibration sequences under TQ-completion. In this talk, we will discuss just that: a fibration theorem which shows that TQ-completion preserves fibration sequences in which the base and total O-algebra are connected. Time permitting, we will also discuss a few preliminary results that hint towards an intrinsic connection between TQ-completion and the convergence of the Taylor tower of the identity functor in the category of O-algebras.

<br>
<I> TQ-completion of certain fibration sequences </I>
<br>
By considering algebras over an operad O in one's preferred category of spectra, we can encode various flavors of algebraic structure (e.g. commutative ring spectra). Drawing intuition from singular homology of spaces and Quillen homology of rings, topological Quillen (TQ) homology is a naturally occurring notion of homology for these objects, with analogies to both singular homology and stabilization of spaces. 

For a given O-algebra X, there is a canonical way (following Bousfield-Kan) to "glue together" iterates TQ^n(X) of the TQ-homology spectrum of X to construct "the part of X that TQ-homology sees," namely its TQ-completion. We then ask, "When can X be 'recovered from' TQ(X) in this way?"

Bousfield-Kan consider the analogous question in spaces and conclude that all nilpotent spaces are weakly equivalent to their homology completion. The key technical maneuver of their proof involves showing that certain fibration sequences are preserved by completion. In this talk, we will review the construction of TQ-homology and discuss certain types of fibration sequences of O-algebras which are preserved by TQ-completion.<br>

<b>Young Topologists Meeting, EPFL (2019)</b>
<br>
<I> Topological Quillen homology of structured ring spectra </I>
<br>
Around 2000, a number of new categories of spectra were created that carry with them additional structure in the form of a smash product, providing a rich setting in which to study spaces and spectra. By considering algebras over an operad O in one of these new categories (e.g. symmetric spectra) we can encode various flavors of algebraic structure now afforded to us, such as that of a commutative ring spectrum. In order to study these algebras, we introduce a filtration of the operad itself which, in turn, filters the encoded structure of its corresponding algebras. As luck would have it, this can recover the Taylor tower of the identity functor and the initial term in the tower is the topological Quillen homology of an O-algebra â€” weakly equivalent to stabilization and analogous to the Quillen homology of a commutative ring. In this talk, we will review these constructions in more detail and conclude with a discussion of ongoing research in this area.

<b>Mathematics Colloquium, Vassar College (2019)</b>
<br>
<I> Homotopy theory -- from the fundamental group to structured ring spectra </I>
<br>
Topological spaces can be found in almost all areas of mathematics; examples abound and include subsets of Euclidean space, metric spaces, and much more. Given two spaces, one of the most basic questions we can ask is, "Are they the same?" and the search for an answer to this seemingly simple question has led to the creation of an incredible amount of both deep and beautiful mathematics. This talk will begin with a discussion of one of the first answers to this question -- namely the fundamental group of PoincarÃ©. Seeking to improve on this construction will naturally lead us to define the higher homotopy groups of a space. The study of these powerful invariants will, in turn, bring us to stable homotopy theory and the "brave new algebra" of structured ring spectra and we will conclude with a direction of current research. Much of this talk will be general in nature and should be accessible to any undergraduate who has taken, e.g. linear algebra. *No familiarity* with topology will be assumed and, though potentially helpful, experience with group theory is certainly not necessary.

<br><br>

<b>Young Topologists Meeting, University of Copenhagen (2018)</b>
<br>
<I> An introduction to symmetric spectra </I>
<br>
In this expository talk, we begin by briefly motivating and recalling the classical notion of a spectrum, and how to obtain the stable homotopy category as it was first defined. We then examine a conceptually simpler way to view spectra â€“ as modules over the sphere spectrum, a (noncommutative) monoid. By taking this viewpoint, we will see why defining a symmetric monoidal product on the category of spectra is problematic, just as in classical algebra, the tensor product of two R-modules does not itself necessarily carry the structure of an R-module if R is not commutative. This motivates the introduction of a symmetric group action on spectra, which turns the sphere spectrum into a commutative monoid, allowing a straightforward definition of the smash product on the category of symmetric spectra. We will conclude with a description of the stable model structure on symmetric spectra, and how it determines the classical stable homotopy category.
